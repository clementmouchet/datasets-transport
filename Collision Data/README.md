## Collision Data

These files provide detailed data about the circumstances of personal injury road accidents, the types of vehicles involved and the consequential casualties. The statistics relate only to personal injury accidents on public roads that are reported to the police, and subsequently recorded, using the STATS19 accident reporting form. Information on damage-only accidents, with no human casualties or accidents on private roads or car parks are not included in this data.

Very few, if any, fatal accidents do not become known to the police although it is known that a considerable proportion of non-fatal injury accidents are not reported to the police. Figures for deaths refer to persons killed immediately or who died within 30 days of the accident. This is the usual international definition, adopted by the Vienna Convention in 1968.
