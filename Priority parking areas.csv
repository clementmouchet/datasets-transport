Arboretum/Kinnear,"Priority Parking","A public consultation on proposals for a Priority Parking scheme in the area was held in August 2012. The results were reported to the Transport and Environment Committee in November 2012 where Committee approved the recommendation to proceed with the implementation of the scheme.
The main aim of Priority Parking is to help residents park closer to their homes by introducing part-time residents’ parking places in their area. While these spaces only operate for a short period each day, they aim to help make parking easier for residents, their visitors or those making deliveries during the day. The remaining kerbside space will be uncontrolled.
The scheme started on 4 March 2013 and a letter was delivered to each household within the area to inform residents of the start date and how to apply for a parking permit.","3 to 28 August 2012",,,"4 March 2013",,"<a href=""http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/download/meetings/id/32953/item_18-priority_parking-various_areas_edinburgh"">Priority Parking report</a>",,"<a href=""http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/download/meetings/id/37287/item_no_81_objection_to_arboretumkinnear_priority_parking_area-traffic_regulation_order"">Priority Parking Consultation report</a>",,"<a href=""http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/downloads/file/9696/b3_implementation_letter"">Letter to residents</a>","<a href=""http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/downloads/file/8253/arboretumkinnear_advertised_plan"">Advertised plan</a>",,,,"<a href=""https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/downloads/download/1676/priority_parking_information_sheet"">Information Sheet</a>",,"Controlled Parking Zones, 249 High Street, Edinburgh, EH1 1YJ","0131 469 3309",controlledparkingzone@edinburgh.gov.uk
Ashley,"Controlled Parking Zone Extension","A public consultation on controlled parking proposals ran from 7 October until 1 November 2011. Letters were sent to all properties within the area and residents were asked for their views on the proposals.
The results of the consultation were reported to the Transport, Infastructure & Environment Committee on 21 February 2012. The consultation found that there was insufficient support for a controlled parking scheme to be introduced. The majority of residents who responded did not consider controls would help them to find a parking place closer to their homes during the day. Committee decided not to extend the parking controls but to continue to work with residents to find a solution to parking pressures in the area.
Proposals are being developed to bring forward measures which will address residents concerns.
